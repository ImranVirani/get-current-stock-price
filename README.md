# Usage
This application uses the AlphaVantage API. Setup a [free account](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) with them to 
use this application. Create a file called apikey.json and create a single json 
key value pair with "api_key" being the key and the value being your api key as 
shown below. DO NOT TRACK YOUR apikey.json FILE. It's generally considered 
good practice to always hide your API key.
``
{
      "api_key" : "<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>"
}
